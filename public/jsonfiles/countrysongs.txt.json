Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down  Mama dabbled a little bit of perfume on my neck and then she kissed my cheek And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes as she started to speak She looked at a pitiful shack And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath She said, &quot;Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick, And the baby's gonna starve to death.&quot;  She handed me a heart shaped locket that said, &quot;To thine own self be true.&quot; And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high heeled shoe It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' Askin', &quot;Mama, what do I do?&quot; She said, &quot;Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy, And they'll be nice to you.&quot;  She said, &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.&quot; Lord, forgive me for what I do, But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down Now your mama's gonna move you uptown  Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ain't been back  But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly What my Mama'd been talkin' about  I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow That I's gonna be a lady someday Though I didn't know when or how But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame You know I might have been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my name  She said, &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. She said, &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.  It wasn't long after that benevolent man took me off the street And one week later I was pourin' his tea in a five room hotel suite  I charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat And then I got me a Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done bad  Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites That would call me bad They criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had  But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for nigh on fifteen years Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor Mama's voice ringin' in my ears  &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.&quot; Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out well it's up to you Now don't let me down Now your Mama's gonna move you uptown  Well, I guess she did ",

He kept some letters by his bed Dated 1962  He had underlined in red Every single I love you.  I went to see him just today Oh, but I didn't see no tears All dressed up to go away First time I'd seen him smile in years.  He stopped loving her today They placed a wreath upon his door And soon they'll carry him away He stopped loving her today.  <i>[Spoken:]</i> Ya' know she came to see him one last time Oh, we all wondered if she would And it kept running through my mind This time he's over her for good.  <i>[Sang:]</i> He stopped loving her today They placed a wreath upon his door And soon they'll carry him away He stopped loving her today...

Like me, he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry  The silence of a falling star Lights up a purple sky And as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry ",

Wondering What in the world did I do?  Oh, crazy For thinking that my love could hold you I'm crazy for trying And crazy for crying And I'm crazy for loving you  Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you I'm crazy for trying And crazy for crying And I'm crazy for loving  You ",
