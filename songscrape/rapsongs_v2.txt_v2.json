I got some skeletons in my closet\nAnd I don't know if no one knows it\nSo before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it\nI'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD\nI was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch\nCause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die\nI look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side\nEven if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try\nTo make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake\nI maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today\nWhat I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun\nCause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;\n\nI'm sorry momma!\nI never meant to hurt you!\nI never meant to make you cry; but tonight\nI'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)\nI said I'm sorry momma!\nI never meant to hurt you!\nI never meant to make you cry, but tonight\nI'm cleaning out my closet\n\nNow I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition\nTake a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing\nBut put yourself in my position; just try to envision\nWitnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen\nBitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing\nGoing through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome\nMy whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't\n'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach\nDoesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?\nSo you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?\nBut guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely\nAnd Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony\nAnd Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful\nBut you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral!\nSee what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong\nBitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom!\nBut how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get\nYou selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit\nRemember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?\nWell guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be!\n\nI'm sorry momma!\nI never meant to hurt you!\nI never meant to make you cry; but tonight\nI'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)\nI said I'm sorry momma!\nI never meant to hurt you!\nI never meant to make you cry, but tonight\nI'm cleaning out my closet\n\nI'm sorry momma!\nI never meant to hurt you!\nI never meant to make you cry; but tonight\nI'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)\nI said I'm sorry momma!\nI never meant to hurt you!\nI never meant to make you cry, but tonight\nI'm cleaning out my closet\n"
