        "lyrics": "\r\nI said a hip hop,\nThe hippie, the hippie,\nTo the hip, hip hop, and you don't stop, a rock it\nTo the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie,\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.\nNow, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,\nAnd me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.\nSee, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,\nTo the black, to the white, the red and the brown,\nThe purple and yellow. But first, I gotta\nBang bang, the boogie to the boogie,\nSay up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,\nLet's rock, you don't stop,\nRock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.\nWell so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,\nAnd the next on the mic is my man Hank,\nC'mon, Hank, sing that song!\n\nCheck it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,\nAnd the rest is F-L-Y,\nYou see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,\nAnd these reasons I'll tell you why.\nYou see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun\nWhen I dress to a T,\nYou see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali\nand I dress so viciously.\nI got bodyguards, I got two big cars\nThat definitely ain't the wack,\nI got a Lincoln Continental and a sun-roofed Cadillac.\nSo after school I take a dip in the pool,\nWhich is really on the wall,\nI got a colour TV, so I can see\nThe Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about\nCheckbooks, credit cards, mo' money\nThan a sucker could ever spend,\nBut I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker\nNot a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go\nHo-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today? (say what?)\n'Cause I'm a get a fly girl,\nGonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go\nHo-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,\nSay if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.\nMaster Gee! My mellow!\nIt's on to you, so what you gonna do?\n\nWell, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn.\nI said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,\nI said I go by the unforgettable name\nOf the man they call the Master Gee.\nWell, my name is known all over the world\nBy all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.\nI'm goin' down in history\nAs the baddest rapper there ever could be.\nNow I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,\nThe beat starts gettin' into your toes\nYou start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet\nAnd movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat\nAnd then damn! Ya start doin' the freak, I said\nDamn! Right outta your seat\nThen you throw your hands high in the air,\nYa rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere\nYa rockin' to the beat without a care,\nWith the sureshot MCs for the affair.\nNow, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang\nBut I rap to the beat just the same.\nI got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes\nAll I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize\nSingin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nSingin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,\nLike a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie\nPop da pop pop, don't you dare stop\nCome alive y'all, gimme what you got\nI guess by now you can take a hunch\nAnd find that I am the baby of the bunch\nBut that's okay, I still keep in stride,\n'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind\nSingin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn.\nSingin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,\nRock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor\nI'm gonna freak you here, I'm gonna freak you there,\nI'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.\n'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind\nI'll put TNT in your behind. I said\nOne, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor\nA-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what you got\n'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock\nI said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nI said a hip hop,\nThe hippie to the hippie\nThe hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it\nTo the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.\nA Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,\nAnd guess what, America, we love you\n'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,\nYou could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.\nI don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,\nBut we're like hot butter on your breakfast toast\nRock it up, Baby Bubba!\nBaby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie\nTo the beat, beat, it's so unique\nCome on everybody and dance to the beat!\n\n<i>[Drum break]</i>\n\nA hip hop\nThe hippie to the hippie the\nHip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it\nRock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang\nThe boogie to the boogie, the beat.\nI said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week\nWhen I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat\nAnd I attempt to raise your body heat.\nJust blow your mind, so you can't speak\nAnd do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet\nAnd let it change up to a dance called the freak\nAnd when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,\nRest a little while so you don't get weak.\nI know a man named Hank\nHe has more rhymes than a serious bank\nSo come on Hank, sing that song,\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!\n\nWell, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,\nThe women fight for my delight.\nBut I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\nAnd when you come inside, into the front,\nYou do the freak, spank, and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker MC try to prove a point,\nWe're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!\na-From sun to sun and from time to time\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI've created a devastating masterpiece\nI'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,\nEverybody, I say it goes like this\nWell, I was walking home late one afternoon\nA reporter stopped me for an interview\nShe said she's heard stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable\nThis young reporter I did adore,\nSo I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before\nShe said, &quot;Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you\nThe Casanova legend must have been true&quot;\nI said, &quot;By the way, baby, what's your name?&quot;\nSaid, &quot;I go by name of Lois Lane\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman.&quot;\nI said, &quot;He's a fairy, I do suppose\nFlyin' through the air in pantyhose\nHe may be very sexy, or even cute,\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,&quot;\nI said, &quot;You need a man man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\nHe may be able to fly all through the night,\nBut can he rock a party 'til the early light?\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm,\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm!&quot;\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it.\nAn' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere\nJust throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don't care\nLet's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!\nGo ho-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today? (Say what?)\nI'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,\nEverybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot;\nYou say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\nI can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,\nSo I just tak half, and bust 'em out,\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house\nIt was twelve o'clock one Friday night\nI was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right\nEverybody was dancin' on the floor\nDoin' all the things they never did before\nAnd then this fly girl with a sexy lean\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\nShe travelled deeper inside the room\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassoons\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\nSo I said to myself, it's time for me to release\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\nAnd now people in the house, this is just for you\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\nNow the group you hear is called Phase Two\nAnd let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew\nOnce a week, we're on the street\nJust to cut in the jams and look at your feet\nFor you to party, you gotta have the moves,\nSo we'll get right down and get you a groove\nFor you to dance, you got to be hot\nSo we'll get right down and make you rock\nNow the system's on and the girls are there\nYou definitely have a rockin' affair\nBut let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact\nAnd to have a party, you got to have a rap\nSo when the party's over, you're makin' it home,\nAnd tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn\nAnd while you're sleepin', you start to dream,\nAnd thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene\nMy name appears in your mind,\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\nIt was Phase Two just doin' a do\nRockin' you down 'cause you knew we could\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,\nCome alive girls, get on your feet\nTo the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that makes you freak\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\nOn'n'on into the break of dawn\nNow I got a man comin' on right now\nHe's guaranteed to throw down\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\nCome on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!\n\nI say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,\nLike a millionaire that has no money\nLike a rainy day that is not wet,\nLike a gamblin' fiend that does not bet\nLike Dracula without his fangs,\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang\nLike collard greens that don't taste good,\nLike a tree that's not made out of wood\nLike goin' up and not comin' down,\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\nTo the beat beat, you do the freak\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\nHave you ever went over a friends house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good?\nThe macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says, &quot;Mama, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!&quot;\nSo your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says &quot;Man, there's plenty of food&quot;\nSo you pile some more on your plate\nWhile the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'\nInto something that looks like cheese\nOh so you say &quot;That's it, I gotta leave this place\nI don't care what these people think,\nI'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks&quot;\nSo you bust out the door while it's still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says, &quot;I understand about the food,\nBaby Bubba, but we're still friends&quot;\nWith a hip hop the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'\nTo the bang bang boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat\nI say, &quot;Hank, can ya rock?\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?\nCan ya hip me to the shoobie doo?&quot;\nI said, &quot;Come on, make, make the people move!&quot;\n\nI go to the balls and then ring the bell\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well,\nA Big Bang, I got clientele\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\nI never forgot what I was told\nIt was the best advice I ever had\nIt came from my wise, dear old dad\nHe said, &quot;Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\nAnd don't say a word until I'm through\nNow there's a time to laugh, a time to cry\nA time to live and a time to die\nA time to break and a time to chill\nTo act civilized or act real ill\nBut whatever you do in your lifetime\nYou never let an MC steal your rhyme&quot;\nSo from six to six 'til this very day\nI'll always remember what he had to say\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\nI let them know that I'm versatile\nI got style, finesse, and a little black book\nThat's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\nBut the thing that separates you from me\nAnd that is called originality\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you heard\nI didn't even bite, not a go---word\nAnd I say a little more, later on tonight\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\nA tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all\nA let's rock, y'all, you don't stop\nYa go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today?&quot; (Say what?)\nYa say, &quot;I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and\n\nDrive off in a def OJ&quot;\nEverybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot;\nYa say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends\nA like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all\nBeat beat y'all, ya don't stop!\nA Master Gee, my mellow\nIt's on to you so what you gonna do?\n\nWell, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\nWell like the Barkay's singin' &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;\nThe sounds to throw down, they're played the most\nIt's like my man Captain Sky\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\nWe rock and we don't stop\nGet off, y'all, I'm here to give you what you got\nTo the beat that it makes you freak\nAnd come alive, girl, get on your feet\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\nLike the Barkays on the mic\nLike gettin' down right for you tonight\nLike movin' your body so you don't know how\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\nLike comin' alive to the Master Gee\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\nI said the age of one, my life begun\nAt the age of two I was doin' the do\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\nRockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\nGivin' all the freaks what they bargained for\nAt the age of five I didn't take no jive\nWith the Master Gee it's all the way live\nAt the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks\nRappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed\nAt the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven\nDon't you know I went off\nI gotta run on down to the beat you see\nGettin' right on down, makin' all the girls\nJust take off their clothes to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that makes you freak\nAt the age of eight, I was really great\n'Cause every night, you see, I had a date\nAt the age of nine, I was right on time\n'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\nGoing on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on\nLike a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn...\n",
