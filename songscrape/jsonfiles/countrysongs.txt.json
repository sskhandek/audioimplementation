And I'd have given anything  To have my own PacMan game at home.  I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade;  Now I've got it on my phone.   He-e-ey...  Glory glory hallelujah.  Welcome to the future.   My grandpa was in World War II,  He fought against the Japanese.  He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma;  Mailed em from his base in the Philippines.   I wish they could see this now,  Where they say this change can go.  Cause I was on a video chat this morning  With a company in Tokyo.   He-e-ey...  Everyday is a revolution.  Welcome to the future.   He-e-ey...  Look around it's all so clear.  He-e-ey...  Wherever we would go and well we...  He-e-ey...  So many things I never thought I'd see...  Happening right in front of me.   I had a friend in school,  Running-back on a football team,  They burned a cross in his front yard  For asking out the home-coming queen.   I thought about him today,  Everybody who's seen what he's seen,  From a woman on a bus  To a man with a dream.   He-e-ey...  Wake up Martin Luther.  Welcome to the future.  He-e-ey...  Glory glory hallelujah.  Welcome to the future. ",

From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her, I've had a change of dreams I'm coming home. But the tears filled my eyes when I found out she was gone. Smoky Mountain rain keeps on falling, I'll keep on calling her name. Smoky Mountain rain, I'll keep on searching, I can't go on hurting this way.  She's somewhere in this Smoky Mountain rain. I can't blame her for letting go, a woman needs someone warm to hold. Feel the rain running down my face, I'll find her no matter what it takes. <i>[repeat chorus]</i> I waved a diesel down outside a cafe, said he was going as far as Gatlinburg. I climbed in the cab all wet and cold and lonely. I wiped my eyes and told him about her. I've got to find her, Can you make these big wheels burn. smoky Mountain rain keeps on falling I'll keep on calling her name.

Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down  Mama dabbled a little bit of perfume on my neck and then she kissed my cheek And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes as she started to speak She looked at a pitiful shack And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath She said, &quot;Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick, And the baby's gonna starve to death.&quot;  She handed me a heart shaped locket that said, &quot;To thine own self be true.&quot; And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high heeled shoe It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' Askin', &quot;Mama, what do I do?&quot; She said, &quot;Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy, And they'll be nice to you.&quot;  She said, &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.&quot; Lord, forgive me for what I do, But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down Now your mama's gonna move you uptown  Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack The welfare people came and took the baby Mama died and I ain't been back  But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly What my Mama'd been talkin' about  I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow That I's gonna be a lady someday Though I didn't know when or how But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame You know I might have been born just plain white trash But Fancy was my name  She said, &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. She said, &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.  It wasn't long after that benevolent man took me off the street And one week later I was pourin' his tea in a five room hotel suite  I charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat And then I got me a Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done bad  Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites That would call me bad They criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had  But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for nigh on fifteen years Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor Mama's voice ringin' in my ears  &quot;Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.&quot; Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out well it's up to you Now don't let me down Now your Mama's gonna move you uptown  Well, I guess she did ",

Lonestar belt buckles and old faded levis,  And each night begins a new day. If you don't understand him, an' he don't die young, He'll prob'ly just ride away.  Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks. Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such. Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. 'Cos they'll never stay home and they're always alone. Even with someone they love.  Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings, Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night. Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do, Sometimes won't know how to take him. He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him, Do things to make you think he's right.  Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks. Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such. Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys. 'Cos they'll never stay home and they're always alone.

He kept her picture on his wall Went half crazy now and then He still loved her through it all Hoping she'd come back again.  He kept some letters by his bed Dated 1962  He had underlined in red Every single I love you.  I went to see him just today Oh, but I didn't see no tears All dressed up to go away First time I'd seen him smile in years.  He stopped loving her today They placed a wreath upon his door And soon they'll carry him away He stopped loving her today.  <i>[Spoken:]</i> Ya' know she came to see him one last time Oh, we all wondered if she would And it kept running through my mind This time he's over her for good.  <i>[Sang:]</i> He stopped loving her today They placed a wreath upon his door And soon they'll carry him away He stopped loving her today...
