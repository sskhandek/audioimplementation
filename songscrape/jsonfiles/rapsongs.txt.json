        "lyrics": " Where's my snare? I have no snare in my headphones - there you go Yeah... yo, yo  Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now  I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;  I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be!  I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet "

You say that like that means somethin to me You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time for you to be comin home talkin that &quot;daddy's home&quot; shit (nigga) We been gettin along fine just without you Me, my brother, and my mother So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. fuck you!     [2Pac] Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night Please send me a pops before puberty the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity Moms always work, I barely see her I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her It's a wonder they don't understand kids today so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way And I hope that he answers me I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family A different father every weekend Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends I'm gettin sick of all the friendships As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick How can I be a man if there's no role model? Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle I'm so sorry...     [Chorus] I'm so sorry for all this time (I'm so sorry) for all this time for all this time (don't lie) I'm so sorry for all this time (so, sorry) for all this time for all this time, so sorry baby!     [Wycked] Moms had to entertain many men Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly That's why I'll never be a father; unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother (That's when I started hatin the phony smiles  Said I was an only child) Look at mama's lonely smile It's hard for a son to see his mother cry She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys I'm so sorry...  [Chorus] I'm so sorry for all this time for all this time for all this time I'm so sorry for all this time for all this time (so sorry) for all this time, so sorry baby!     [2Pac] Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show And ohh -I guess ya didn't know  that I would grow to be so strong Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong Where was the money that you said, you would send me talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly Ask about school and my welfare but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart So don't even start with that &quot;wanna be your father&quot; shit Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me You're so sorry..     [Chorus] I'm so sorry (so sorry) for all this time (so, so sorry) for all this time (I'm so so sorry) for all this time (fuck that!) I'm so sorry for all this time (no) for all this time (so sorry) for all this time, so sorry baby!     [Tupac - impersonating his father] I never meant to leave but I was wanted Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong It took a little longer than I thought I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand all I ever wanted was for you to be a man and grow to be the type you was meant to be Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me I'm so sorry...

When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armour And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?

You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain, scream &quot;Die Shady!&quot; and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin' It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister Almost as if to say  [Chorus/Outro:] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain Just smile back...

Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat, And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet. See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello, To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, The purple and yellow. But first, I gotta Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie, Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie, Let's rock, you don't stop, Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock. Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along, And the next on the mic is my man Hank, C'mon, Hank, sing that song!  Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A, And the rest is F-L-Y, You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix, And these reasons I'll tell you why. You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun When I dress to a T, You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously. I got bodyguards, I got two big cars That definitely ain't the wack, I got a Lincoln Continental and a sun-roofed Cadillac. So after school I take a dip in the pool, Which is really on the wall, I got a colour TV, so I can see The Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money Than a sucker could ever spend, But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker Not a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go Ho-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today? (say what?) 'Cause I'm a get a fly girl, Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn, Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend. Master Gee! My mellow! It's on to you, so what you gonna do?  Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on, The beat don't stop until the break of dawn. I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E, I said I go by the unforgettable name Of the man they call the Master Gee. Well, my name is known all over the world By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls. I'm goin' down in history As the baddest rapper there ever could be. Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows, The beat starts gettin' into your toes You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat And then damn! Ya start doin' the freak, I said Damn! Right outta your seat Then you throw your hands high in the air, Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere Ya rockin' to the beat without a care, With the sureshot MCs for the affair. Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang But I rap to the beat just the same. I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on, The beat don't stop until the break of dawn Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on, Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop Come alive y'all, gimme what you got I guess by now you can take a hunch And find that I am the baby of the bunch But that's okay, I still keep in stride, 'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on, The beat don't stop until the break of dawn. Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on, Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gonna freak you there, I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere. 'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind I'll put TNT in your behind. I said One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what you got 'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike What are you waiting for?  I said a hip hop, The hippie to the hippie The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie, To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat. A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo, And guess what, America, we love you 'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul, You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old. I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast, But we're like hot butter on your breakfast toast Rock it up, Baby Bubba! Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie To the beat, beat, it's so unique Come on everybody and dance to the beat!  [Drum break]  A hip hop The hippie to the hippie the Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang The boogie to the boogie, the beat. I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat And I attempt to raise your body heat. Just blow your mind, so you can't speak And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet And let it change up to a dance called the freak And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat, Rest a little while so you don't get weak. I know a man named Hank He has more rhymes than a serious bank So come on Hank, sing that song, To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!  Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp, The women fight for my delight. But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs That shock the house for the young ladies And when you come inside, into the front, You do the freak, spank, and do the bump And when the sucker MC try to prove a point, We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint! a-From sun to sun and from time to time I sit down and write a brand new rhyme Because they say that miracles never cease I've created a devastating masterpiece I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist, Everybody, I say it goes like this Well, I was walking home late one afternoon A reporter stopped me for an interview She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable This young reporter I did adore, So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before She said, &quot;Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you The Casanova legend must have been true&quot; I said, &quot;By the way, baby, what's your name?&quot; Said, &quot;I go by name of Lois Lane And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can, Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman.&quot; I said, &quot;He's a fairy, I do suppose Flyin' through the air in pantyhose He may be very sexy, or even cute, But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,&quot; I said, &quot;You need a man man who's got finesse And his whole name across his chest He may be able to fly all through the night, But can he rock a party 'til the early light? He can't satisfy you with his little worm, But I can bust you out with my super sperm!&quot; I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it. An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere Just throw your hands up in the air And party hardy like you just don't care Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop! Go ho-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today? (Say what?) I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ, Everybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot; You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend I say skip, dive, what can I say? I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ, So I just tak half, and bust 'em out, I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house It was twelve o'clock one Friday night I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right Everybody was dancin' on the floor Doin' all the things they never did before And then this fly girl with a sexy lean She came into the bar, she came into the scene She travelled deeper inside the room All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons She came up to the table, looked into my eyes Then she turned around and shook her behind So I said to myself, it's time for me to release My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece And now people in the house, this is just for you A little rap to make you boogaloo Now the group you hear is called Phase Two And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew Once a week, we're on the street Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet For you to party, you gotta have the moves, So we'll get right down and get you a groove For you to dance, you got to be hot So we'll get right down and make you rock Now the system's on and the girls are there You definitely have a rockin' affair But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact And to have a party, you got to have a rap So when the party's over, you're makin' it home, And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn And while you're sleepin', you start to dream, And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene My name appears in your mind, Yeah, a name you know that was right on time It was Phase Two just doin' a do Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak, Come alive girls, get on your feet To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat To the double beat beat that makes you freak To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on On'n'on into the break of dawn Now I got a man comin' on right now He's guaranteed to throw down He goes by the name of Wonder Mike Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!  I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey, Like a millionaire that has no money Like a rainy day that is not wet, Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet Like Dracula without his fangs, Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang Like collard greens that don't taste good, Like a tree that's not made out of wood Like goin' up and not comin' down, Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound To the beat beat, you do the freak Everybody just rock and dance to the beat Have you ever went over a friends house to eat And the food just ain't no good? The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed, And the chicken tastes like wood So you try to play it off like you think you can By saying that you're full And then your friend says, &quot;Mama, he's just being polite He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!&quot; So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie And you say that you already ate And your friend says &quot;Man, there's plenty of food&quot; So you pile some more on your plate While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin' Of the moment that it's time to leave And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin' Into something that looks like cheese Oh so you say &quot;That's it, I gotta leave this place I don't care what these people think, I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous With this ugly food that stinks&quot; So you bust out the door while it's still closed Still sick from the food you ate And then you run to the store for quick relief From a bottle of Kaopectate And then you call your friend two weeks later To see how he has been And he says, &quot;I understand about the food, Baby Bubba, but we're still friends&quot; With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin' To the bang bang boogie Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat I say, &quot;Hank, can ya rock? Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop? Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?&quot; I said, &quot;Come on, make, make the people move!&quot;  I go to the balls and then ring the bell Because I am the man with the clientele And if ya ask me why I rock so well, A Big Bang, I got clientele And from the time I was only six years old I never forgot what I was told It was the best advice I ever had It came from my wise, dear old dad He said, &quot;Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you And don't say a word until I'm through Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry A time to live and a time to die A time to break and a time to chill To act civilized or act real ill But whatever you do in your lifetime You never let an MC steal your rhyme&quot; So from six to six 'til this very day I'll always remember what he had to say So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style I let them know that I'm versatile I got style, finesse, and a little black book That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look But the thing that separates you from me And that is called originality Because my rhymes are on from what you heard I didn't even bite, not a go---word And I say a little more, later on tonight So the sucker MCs can bite all night A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop Ya go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today?&quot; (Say what?) Ya say, &quot;I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and  Drive off in a def OJ&quot; Everybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot; Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop! A Master Gee, my mellow It's on to you so what you gonna do?  Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show A like Frankie Crocker in stereo Well like the Barkay's singin' &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; The sounds to throw down, they're played the most It's like my man Captain Sky Whose name he earned with his super sperm We rock and we don't stop Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you what you got To the beat that it makes you freak And come alive, girl, get on your feet A like a Perry Mason without a case Like Farrah Fawcett without her face Like the Barkays on the mic Like gettin' down right for you tonight Like movin' your body so you don't know how Right to the rhythm and throw down Like comin' alive to the Master Gee The brother who rocks so viciously I said the age of one, my life begun At the age of two I was doin' the do At the age of three, it was you and me Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee At the age of four, I was on the floor Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for At the age of five I didn't take no jive With the Master Gee it's all the way live At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven Don't you know I went off I gotta run on down to the beat you see Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat To the double beat beat that makes you freak At the age of eight, I was really great 'Cause every night, you see, I had a date At the age of nine, I was right on time 'Cause every night I had a party rhyme Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on The beat don't stop until the break of dawn A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on Like a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn...

I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins, &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me See Slim; [*screaming*] Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk! Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk, But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?

Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that and here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too? I say that shit just clowning dogg, c'mon - how fucked up is you? You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was... it was you Damn!

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure  Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart  Something that stimulates the music in my measure  Measure in my music, raised in three parts  Casually see but don't do like the Soul  'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys  Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll  Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky  Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air  Criticising rap shows you're out of order  Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires  And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter  A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set  Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production  It stands for &quot;Da Inner Sound Y'all&quot; and y'all can bet  That the action's not a trick, but showing the function   Everybody wants to be a deejay  Everybody wants to be an emcee  But being speakers are the best  And you don't have to guess  De La Soul posse consists of three  And that's the magic number   [DOVE:] This here piece of the pie  Is not dessert but the course that we dine  And three out of every darn time  The effect is &quot;Mmmm&quot; when a daisy grows in your mind  Showing true position, this here piece is  Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin'  When that negative number fills up the casualty  Maybe you can subtract it  You can call it your lucky partner  Maybe you can call it your adjective  But odd as it may be  Without my 1 and 2 where would there be  My 3  Mase Pos and Me  And that's the Magic Number   Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul  Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds  Common are speakers who are never scrolls  Scrolls written daily creates a new sound  Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom  Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug  Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em  For now get 'em high off this dialect drug  Time is a factor so it's time to count  Count not the negative actions of one  Speakers of soul say it's time to shout  Three forms the soul to a positive sum  Dance to this fix and flex every muscle  Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber  Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle  Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number   Now you may try to subtract it  But it just won't go away  Three times one?

Never seen like a shadow in the dark except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin So what about the bitch who got shot?  Fuck her! You think I give a damn about a bitch?  I ain't a sucker! This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton  [Chorus:]  (City of Compton, City of Compton)  (Damn that shit was dope!)

I got nothin to lose, much to gain, In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine. I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right. [something] my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight. So many hos on my jock, think I'm a movie star. Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car. Go to school, I ain't goin for it, Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet.

You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down. You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels. Look at that ring right there, I know it's real, it's gotta be real. Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life! Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man, How can I be down?  What's up?  You say you wanna be down? Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down. Out my face, fool I'm the illest, Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis. Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags, So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags. All I think about is keys and Gs Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha). That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke, When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke. Ya don't like my lifestyle?  Fuck you! I'm rollin with the New Jack crew. And I'm a hustler.  H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler New Jack, New Jack..........  Here I come, so you better break North, As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth. I care nothing bout you, and that's evident. All I love's my dope and dead presidents. Sound crazy?  Well it isn't. The ends justifies the means, that's the system. I learned that in school then I dropped out, Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout. I had nothing, and I wanted it. You had everything, and you flaunted it. Turned the needy into the greedy, With cocaine, my success came speedy. Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox. Every dollar I get, another brother drops. Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand, God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand. But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned, I gotta get paid, I got money to earn. With my posse, out on the ave, Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh. Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam, Is this a nightmare?  Or the American dream? So think twice if you're coming down my block, You wanna journey through hell?  Well shit gets hot. Pregnant teens, children's screams, Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam. You don't come here much, and ya better not. Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot. I gotta get more money than you got,  So what, if some muthafucka gets shot? That's how the game is played, Another brother slayed, the wound is deep BUT they're givin us a Band Aid. My education's low but I got long dough, Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro. Sleep on silk, lie like a politician, My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician. Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe, There'll be another one after me! A hustler. Hustler.

Rewind that back  This is the age for a new stage of fiend  Watch how the junkies scream  For their crack  &quot;It's the crack&quot;t should explain it from the start  Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart  Now the Base claims shot over every part   (Say no go)  (Say no go)  (Don't even think about it)  (Say no go)  (Say no go) ",

They showed me where it was for the moment I didn't know I was in for such an event So I came to her room and opened the door Oh, snap! Guess what I saw? A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth, I was so in shock my heart went down south So please listen to the message that I say Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend ",

I rope a dope the evil with righteous Bobbin' and weavin' and let the good get even C'mon down And welcome to the Terrordome. Caught in the race against time The pit and the pendulum Check the rhythm and rhymes While I'm bendin' 'em Snakes blowin' up the lines of design Tryin' to blind the science I'm snedin' 'em How to fight the power Cannot run and hide But it shouldn't be suicide In a game a fool without the rules Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize Every brother ain't a brother Cause a Black hand Squeezed on Malcom X the man The shootin' of Huey Newton From a hand of a Nigger who pulled the trigger  It's weak to speak and blame somebody else When you destroy yourself First nothing's worse than a mother's pain Of a son slain in Bensonhurst Can't wait for the state to decide the fate So this jam I dedicate Places with racist faces Just an example of one of many cases The Greek weekend speech I speak From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach) I don't smile in the line of fire I go wildin' But it's on bass and drums even violins Watcha do gitcha head ready Instead of gettin' physically sweaty When I get mad I put it down on a pad Give ya somethin' that cha never had controllin' Fear of high rollin' God bless your soul and keep livin' Never allowed, kickin' it loud Droppin' a bomb Brain game intellectual Vietnam Move as a team Never move alone But Welcome to the Terrordome ",

        "lyrics": " You are appreciated  [Verse One: 2Pac]        When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool with the big boys, breakin all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary? Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day And runnin from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside And even as a crack fiend, mama You always was a black queen, mama I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  [Chorus: Reggie Green &amp; &quot;Sweet Franklin&quot; w/ 2Pac]  Lady...  Don't cha know we love ya?  Sweet lady Dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't cha know we love ya?  [second and third chorus, &quot;And dear mama&quot; instead of &quot;Dear mama&quot;]  [Verse Two: 2Pac]  Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was lookin for a father he was gone I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin I needed money of my own so I started slangin I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin money in your mailbox I love payin rent when the rent's due I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you comin home after work late You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate Ya just workin with the scraps you was given And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin But now the road got rough, you're alone You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  [Chorus]  [Verse Three: 2Pac]  Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act craaazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate, how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if ya hold on It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  [Chorus]  Sweet lady And dear mama  Dear mama Lady [3X] ",

This shirt cost $20&quot; I said, &quot;Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!&quot; The next half hour was the same old thing My mother buying me clothes from 1963 And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips! I said, &quot;Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep&quot; She said, &quot;You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet&quot; I said, &quot;Mom, let's put these clothes back, please&quot; She said &quot;no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show&quot; I said, &quot;This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers But if you don't want to I can live with that but You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks&quot; She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same Inevitably the first day of school came I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick But my mom said, &quot;No, no way, uh-uh, forget it&quot; There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought And those who weren't laughing still had a ball Because they were pointing and whispering As I walked down the hall I got home and told my Mom how my day went She said, &quot;If they were laughing you don't need them, Cause they're not good friends&quot; For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times So to you all the kids all across the land There's no need to argue Parents just don't understand  Oh-kay, here's the situation My parents went away on a week's vacation and They left the keys to the brand new Porsche Would they mind? Umm, well, of course not I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah, of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions I honked my horn just to get her attention She said, &quot;Was that for me?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah&quot; She said, &quot;Why?&quot; I said, &quot;Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy&quot; She said, &quot;How do I know you're not sick? You could be some deranged lunatic&quot; I said, &quot;C'mon toots - my name is the Prince = Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?&quot; She agreed and we were on our way She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes She kicked her shoes off onto the floor She said, &quot;Drive fast, speed turns me on&quot; She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast The sun roof was open , the music was high And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche And to make this long story short - short When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell I said, &quot;I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer&quot; I almost had a heart attack that day Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway I was arrested, the car was impounded There was no way for me to avoid being grounded My parents had to come off from vacation to get me I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me My parents walked in I got my grip, I said, &quot;Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?&quot; They didn't speak - I said, &quot;I want to plead my case&quot; But my father just shoved me in the car by my face That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving I can't believe it, I just made a mistake Well parents are the same no matter time nor place So to you all the kids all across the land Take it from me, parents just don't understand ",

At least not now, it'll take a while I change the pace to complete the beat I drop the bass,'till mc's get weak. For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep... 'Cause when I speak, they freak To sweat the technique I made my debut in '86 Wit a melody and a president's mix And now I stay on target and refuse to miss And I still make hits wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps My underground sound vibrates the streets MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps When they sweat the technique  Don't Sweat the Technique  They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but Researchers never found all the pieces yet Scientists try to solve the context Philosophers are wondering what's next Pieces are took to last who observe them They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them My ideas are only for the audience's ears For my opponents, it might take years Pencils and pens, are swords Letters put together form a key to chords I'm also a sculpture, born with structure Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the Difficult styles that'll be for the technology Complete sights and new heights after I get deep You don't have to speak just seek And peep the technique  But don't sweat the technique  I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap Then I get deep and the weak then complete their Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete They never grow old techniques become antiques Better then something  brand new 'cause it's radiant And the wild style'll have much more volume Classical too intelligent to be radical Masterful, never  irrelevant: mathematical Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas It's cool when you freak to the beat But don't sweat the technique  Don't sweat the technique [x2] ",

I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf so just let me introduce myself My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty. Yo ladies, oh how I like to hump thee. And all the rappers in the top ten-please allow me to bump thee. I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty you're gonna fall when the stereos pump me. I like to rhyme,   I like my beats funky, I'm spunky.  I like my oatmeal lumpy. I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack but sometimes I get ridiculous I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice hey yo fat girl, c'mere-are ya ticklish? Yeah, I called ya fat.

You had a chance to show 'em what time it is... [Dr. Dre:] So, what you want me to do? Express Yourself...  [Dr. Dre:] I'm expressin' with my full capabilities, And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities, Cause some don't agree with how I do this. I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist I'm droppin' flava, my behaviour is heriditery, But my technique is very necessary. Blame it on Ice Cube... Because he says it gets funky When you got a subject and a predacit. Add it on a dope beat And that'll make you think. Some suckaz just tickle me pink To my stomache. 'Cause they don't flow like this one. You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one Or two before I'm through. So don't try to sing this! Some drop science While I'm droppin' English. Even if Yella Makes it a-capella I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or a sess. Cause its known to give a brother brain damage. And brain damage on the mic don't manage Nuthin' But makin' a sucker and you equal. Don't be another sequel...  Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it...  Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it...  Now, gettin' back to the PG. That's program, and it's easy. Dre is back. Newjacks, I mean hollow, Expressin' ain't their subject Because they like to follow The words, the style, the trend, The records I spin. Again and again and again Yo, you on the other end. Whatch a brother playin' dope rhymes with no help. There's no fessin' and guessin' While I'm expressin myself. It's crazy to see people be What society wants them to be. But not me! Ruthless... Is the way to go They know. Others say rhymes that fail  To be original. Or they kill where the hiphop starts, Forget about the ghetto And rap for the pop charts. Some musicians curse at home But scared to use profanity When up on the microphone. Yeah, they want reality. But you won't hear none. They rather exaggerate, a little fiction. Some say no to drugs and take a stand, But after the show they go lookin' for the dopeman. Or they ban my group from the radio. Hear NWA and say &quot;Hell no!&quot;.  But you know it ain't all about wealth. As long as you make a note to...  Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it...  Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it...  Express Yourself... From the heart. Cause if you wanna start to move up the chart Then expression is a big part of it. You ain't efficient when you flow You ain't swift, movin' like a tortoise. Full of rigor mortis. There's a little bit more to show I got rhymes in my mind, and better like an embryo. Or a lesson - all of 'em expression And if you start fessin' - I got a Smith and Wessun For you. I might ignore your record  Because it has no bottom. I get loose in the summer. When in spring and autumn It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical. Doin' the job NWA is the lynch mob! Yes, I'm a cob? But you know you need this. And the knowledge is growin' Just like a foetus, or a tumor. But here's the rumor: Dre is in the neighborhood And he's up to no good. When I start expressin' myself, Yella, slam it! Cause If I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage. Or I'mma be too hyped, And need a straight jacket. I got knowledge and other suckaers lack it. So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic, Ask what it's like. It's like we gettin' hype tonight. Cause if I strike It ain't for your good health. But I won't strike if you just...  Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it...  Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it...  Express Yourself... Come on and do it... Come on and do it... Come on and do it... Come on and do it... [music fades] ",
