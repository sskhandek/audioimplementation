But first, I gotta\nBang bang, the boogie to the boogie,\nSay up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,\nLet's rock, you don't stop,\nRock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.\nWell so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,\nAnd the next on the mic is my man Hank,\nC'mon, Hank, sing that song!\n\nCheck it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,\nAnd the rest is F-L-Y,\nYou see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,\nAnd these reasons I'll tell you why.\nYou see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun\nWhen I dress to a T,\nYou see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali\nand I dress so viciously.\nI got bodyguards, I got two big cars\nThat definitely ain't the wack,\nI got a Lincoln Continental and a sun-roofed Cadillac.\nSo after school I take a dip in the pool,\nWhich is really on the wall,\nI got a colour TV, so I can see\nThe Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about\nCheckbooks, credit cards, mo' money\nThan a sucker could ever spend,\nBut I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker\nNot a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go\nHo-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today? (say what?)\n'Cause I'm a get a fly girl,\nGonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go\nHo-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,\nSay if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.\nMaster Gee! My mellow!\nIt's on to you, so what you gonna do?\n\nWell, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn.\nI said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,\nI said I go by the unforgettable name\nOf the man they call the Master Gee.\nWell, my name is known all over the world\nBy all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.\nI'm goin' down in history\nAs the baddest rapper there ever could be.\nNow I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,\nThe beat starts gettin' into your toes\nYou start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet\nAnd movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat\nAnd then damn! Ya start doin' the freak, I said\nDamn!

(Say what?)\nI'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,\nEverybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot;\nYou say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\nI can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,\nSo I just tak half, and bust 'em out,\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house\nIt was twelve o'clock one Friday night\nI was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right\nEverybody was dancin' on the floor\nDoin' all the things they never did before\nAnd then this fly girl with a sexy lean\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\nShe travelled deeper inside the room\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassoons\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\nSo I said to myself, it's time for me to release\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\nAnd now people in the house, this is just for you\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\nNow the group you hear is called Phase Two\nAnd let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew\nOnce a week, we're on the street\nJust to cut in the jams and look at your feet\nFor you to party, you gotta have the moves,\nSo we'll get right down and get you a groove\nFor you to dance, you got to be hot\nSo we'll get right down and make you rock\nNow the system's on and the girls are there\nYou definitely have a rockin' affair\nBut let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact\nAnd to have a party, you got to have a rap\nSo when the party's over, you're makin' it home,\nAnd tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn\nAnd while you're sleepin', you start to dream,\nAnd thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene\nMy name appears in your mind,\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\nIt was Phase Two just doin' a do\nRockin' you down 'cause you knew we could\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,\nCome alive girls, get on your feet\nTo the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that makes you freak\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\nOn'n'on into the break of dawn\nNow I got a man comin' on right now\nHe's guaranteed to throw down\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\nCome on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!\n\nI say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,\nLike a millionaire that has no money\nLike a rainy day that is not wet,\nLike a gamblin' fiend that does not bet\nLike Dracula without his fangs,\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang\nLike collard greens that don't taste good,\nLike a tree that's not made out of wood\nLike goin' up and not comin' down,\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\nTo the beat beat, you do the freak\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\nHave you ever went over a friends house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good?\nThe macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says, &quot;Mama, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!&quot;\nSo your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says &quot;Man, there's plenty of food&quot;\nSo you pile some more on your plate\nWhile the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'\nInto something that looks like cheese\nOh so you say &quot;That's it, I gotta leave this place\nI don't care what these people think,\nI'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks&quot;\nSo you bust out the door while it's still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says, &quot;I understand about the food,\nBaby Bubba, but we're still friends&quot;\nWith a hip hop the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'\nTo the bang bang boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat\nI say, &quot;Hank, can ya rock?\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?\nCan ya hip me to the shoobie doo?&quot;\nI said, &quot;Come on, make, make the people move!&quot;\n\nI go to the balls and then ring the bell\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well,\nA Big Bang, I got clientele\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\nI never forgot what I was told\nIt was the best advice I ever had\nIt came from my wise, dear old dad\nHe said, &quot;Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\nAnd don't say a word until I'm through\nNow there's a time to laugh, a time to cry\nA time to live and a time to die\nA time to break and a time to chill\nTo act civilized or act real ill\nBut whatever you do in your lifetime\nYou never let an MC steal your rhyme&quot;\nSo from six to six 'til this very day\nI'll always remember what he had to say\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\nI let them know that I'm versatile\nI got style, finesse, and a little black book\nThat's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\nBut the thing that separates you from me\nAnd that is called originality\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you heard\nI didn't even bite, not a go---word\nAnd I say a little more, later on tonight\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\nA tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all\nA let's rock, y'all, you don't stop\nYa go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, what you gonna do today?&quot; (Say what?)\nYa say, &quot;I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and\n\nDrive off in a def OJ&quot;\nEverybody go, &quot;Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn&quot;\nYa say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends\nA like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all\nBeat beat y'all, ya don't stop!\nA Master Gee, my mellow\nIt's on to you so what you gonna do?\n\nWell, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\nWell like the Barkay's singin' &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;\nThe sounds to throw down, they're played the most\nIt's like my man Captain Sky\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\nWe rock and we don't stop\nGet off, y'all, I'm here to give you what you got\nTo the beat that it makes you freak\nAnd come alive, girl, get on your feet\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\nLike the Barkays on the mic\nLike gettin' down right for you tonight\nLike movin' your body so you don't know how\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\nLike comin' alive to the Master Gee\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\nI said the age of one, my life begun\nAt the age of two I was doin' the do\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\nRockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\nGivin' all the freaks what they bargained for\nAt the age of five I didn't take no jive\nWith the Master Gee it's all the way live\nAt the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks\nRappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed\nAt the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven\nDon't you know I went off\nI gotta run on down to the beat you see\nGettin' right on down, makin' all the girls\nJust take off their clothes to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that makes you freak\nAt the age of eight, I was really great\n'Cause every night, you see, I had a date\nAt the age of nine, I was right on time\n'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\nGoing on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on\nLike a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn...\n",

Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth,\nI was so in shock my heart went down south\nSo please listen to the message that I say\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend\n",

I mean why?\nWhat kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?\nWhat kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?\nWhat kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?\nI mean shit he bought you things and gave you diamond rings\nBut them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings\nAnd you stayed, what made you fall for him?\nThat nigga had the power to make you crawl for him\nI thought you was a doctor be on call for him\nSmacked you down cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?\nThat wasn't love, babygirl you was dreamin'\nI could have killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen\n\n<i>[1]</i> - Love is blind, and it will take over your mind\nWhat you think is love, is truly not\nYou need to elevate and find\n\n<i>[Repeat 1]</i>\n\nI don't even know you and I'd kill you myself\nYou played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf\nWouldn't let her go to school and better herself\nShe had a baby by your ass and you ain't giving no help\nUh-huh big time hustler, snake motherfucker\nOne's born everyday and everyday she was your sucker\nHow could you beat the mother of your kids?\nHow could you tell her that you love her?\nDon't give a fuck if she lives\nShe told me she would leave you, I admit it she did\nBut came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids\nSweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress\nHad to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches\nFloss like you possess her, tellin' me to mind my business\nSaid that it was her life and stay the fuck out of it\nI tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip\n\n<i>[Repeat 1 (2x)]</i>\n\nI don't even know you and I want you dead\nDon't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head\nSee I laid down beside her in the hospital bed\nAnd about two hours later, doctors said she was dead\nHad the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day\nTo come and pay your respects and help the family pray\nEven knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop\nAnd before you had a chance to get up\nYou heard my gun cock\nPrayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend\nI ain't start your life but nigga I'mma bring it to an end\nAnd I did, clear shots and no regrets, never\nCops comin' lock me under the jail\nNigga whatever my bitch, fuck it my sister\nYou could never figure out even if I let you live\nWhat our love was all about\nI considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker\n\n<i>[Repeat 1]</i>\n",
